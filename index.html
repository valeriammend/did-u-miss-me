                    <h2>With the new technologies and the rapid implementation of AI,
                        <br> I have been reflecting on the principles of technological assistance.
                        <br> Clippy, as an assistant, had many flaws: it would pop up frequently 
                        <br>for no reason, its simple design made it difficult to understand 
                        <br>context, and it often made irrelevant suggestions. 
                        <br>However, during my early years with a computer, using 
                        <br>the old Microsoft system, I liked Clippy a lot.
                        <br> Its design gave the system a more relaxed and fun aspect,
                        <br> which was fascinating for me at a time when it was all new.
                        <br> Thatâ€™s why I have created this small website to remember Clippy.</h2>
